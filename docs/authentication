# Multiple signed in roles

The `auth.setup.js` file contains two test fixtures for authenticating as a supervisor and a caseworker. These fixtures perform the necessary steps to authenticate as each user type and save the authentication state to a file.

The authentication state can be loaded in subsequent tests to simulate a logged-in user.

AppURL is set in the environment variable as `NSM_ASSESS_DEV_URL`

## Usage

The helper function exposes two roles `getAuthenticatedSupervisor` and `getAuthenticatedCaseworker` as authenticated user.

To use a page as an authenticated user role, i.e. supervisor,

Import the function

``` js
import { getAuthenticatedSupervisor } from '../../../helpers/index.js';
```

In your test case,

``` js
 test.use({ storageState: getAuthenticatedSupervisor() })
```

Now you can write test as authenticated supervisor role.

# Fixtures

A fixture is a piece of setup or configuration that is needed for tests to run. In this case, the fixture is an instance of the `AllClaimsPage` class, which is presumably a page object that encapsulates the logic for interacting with a specific page.

Here's a short description of how to use this fixture:

- **Import the fixture:** At the top of your test file, import the `test` object from this file:

``` js
import { test } from './path/to/this/file';
```

- **Use the fixture in a test:** In your tests, you can use the `allClaimsPage` fixture as a parameter to your test function:

``` js
test('my test', async ({ allClaimsPage }) => {
  // You can now use allClaimsPage in your test
  await allClaimsPage.someMethod();
});
```

- **Use the expect function:** The `expect` function is used to make assertions in your tests. For example:

``` js
test('my test', async ({ allClaimsPage }) => {
  const result = await allClaimsPage.someMethod();
  expect(result).toBe('expected result');
});
```
